== PROJECT: modsUni


== 1. Overview

*modsUni* is a desktop candidature management application created by university students for students.
It aims to make the tedious process of planning your entire candidature easier and more effective.
It provides students with the ability to view module details and manage their personal candidature plans.

Targeted at individuals whom prefer the use of their keyboards over a click-and-point interface,
it incorporates an in-built Command Line Interface(CLI) for majority of its user interactions and
a simple Graphical User Interface(GUI) for the displaying of output.

== 2. About this Portfolio

This project portfolio details my individual contributions to the *modsUni* project.
It includes a summary of the enhancements and other contributions I made throughout the duration
of the project. Additionally, portions of my contribution to the User Guide and Developer Guide have also
been included.


== 3. Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented a *User Account Management System*

** What it does: Allows users to manage user-specific settings and configurations.
Using a traditional account management system, users can expect a familiar and
intuitive structure when managing their personal details.

** Justification: This enhancement enhances the general user experience, allowing users
to set user specific details and configurations for the application.

** Highlights: This is a full-stack feature incorporating all the components of the application from `Storage` to `UI`.
This enhancement will give users the necessary control over their personal preferences and configurations in the application.

** Relevant pull requests: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/44[#44], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/87[#87] and https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/161[#161]

* *Minor enhancement(s)*: Standardized the *User Interface* of the application.

** What it does: Provides an intuitive and familiar user interface to greatly boost
User Experience(UX).

** Justification: UX is an important aspect to a product's sustainability. By incorporating
an easy-to-use and familiar tool, users can avoid the need to ascertain new processes and
procedures.

** Highlights: Switching of relevant panels will automatically be done after the successful
execution of commands. This brings the focus of the users to the relevant display panels. It is
also noted that commands have been included to allow users to set the front-most display panels manually.

** Relevant pull requests: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/161[#161] and https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/189[#189]
